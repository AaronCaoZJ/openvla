# 🕶️ Quick Start

To get started with loading and running OpenVLA models for inference, we provide a lightweight interface that leverages
HuggingFace `transformers` AutoClasses, with minimal dependencies.

For example, to load `openvla-7b` for zero-shot instruction following in the
[BridgeData V2 environments](https://rail-berkeley.github.io/bridgedata/) with a WidowX robot:

```python
# Install minimal dependencies (`torch`, `transformers`, `timm`, `tokenizers`, ...)
# > pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openvla/openvla/main/requirements-min.txt
from transformers import AutoModelForVision2Seq, AutoProcessor
from PIL import Image

import torch

# Load Processor & VLA
local_model_path = "/home/zhijun/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--openvla--openvla-7b"  # 改为实际环境中的hub路径

processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(local_model_path, trust_remote_code=True)
vla = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained(
    local_model_path, 
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",  # [Optional] Requires `flash_attn`
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    low_cpu_mem_usage=True, 
    trust_remote_code=True
).to("cuda:0")

# Grab image input & format prompt
image: Image.Image = get_from_camera(...)
prompt = "In: What action should the robot take to {<INSTRUCTION>}?\nOut:"

# Predict Action (7-DoF; un-normalize for BridgeData V2)
inputs = processor(prompt, image).to("cuda:0", dtype=torch.bfloat16)
action = vla.predict_action(**inputs, unnorm_key="bridge_orig", do_sample=False)

# Execute...
robot.act(action, ...)
```

# 🎯 Pretrained Checkpoints

We release two OpenVLA models trained as part of our work, with checkpoints, configs, and model cards available [on our
HuggingFace page](https://huggingface.co/openvla):
- [`openvla-7b`](https://huggingface.co/openvla/openvla-7b): The flagship model from our paper, trained from 
  the Prismatic `prism-dinosiglip-224px` VLM (based on a fused DINOv2 and SigLIP vision backbone, and Llama-2 LLM). 
  Trained on a large mixture of datasets from Open X-Embodiment spanning 970K trajectories 
  ([mixture details - see "Open-X Magic Soup++"](./prismatic/vla/datasets/rlds/oxe/mixtures.py)).
- [`openvla-v01-7b`](https://huggingface.co/openvla/openvla-7b-v01): An early model used during development, trained from
  the Prismatic `siglip-224px` VLM (singular SigLIP vision backbone, and a Vicuña v1.5 LLM). Trained on the same mixture
  of datasets as [Octo](https://github.com/octo-models/octo), but for significantly fewer GPU hours than our final model 
  ([mixture details - see "Open-X Magic Soup"](./prismatic/vla/datasets/rlds/oxe/mixtures.py)).

## Installation

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n openvla python=3.10 -y
conda activate openvla

# Clone and install the openvla repo
git clone https://github.com/openvla/openvla.git
cd openvla
pip install -e .

# To match 5090 CUDA compatibility requirement
# Install PyTorch. Below is a sample command to do this, but you should check the following link
pip install torch==2.8.0+cu128 torchvision==0.23.0+cu128 torchaudio==2.8.0+cu128 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

# Install Flash Attention 2 for training (https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)
#   =>> If you run into difficulty, try `pip cache remove flash_attn` first
pip install packaging ninja
ninja --version; echo $?  # Verify Ninja --> should return exit code "0"
pip install "flash-attn==2.8.3" --no-build-isolation
```

See `vla-scripts/` for full training and verification scripts for OpenVLA models. Note that `scripts/` is
mostly a holdover from the original (base) `prismatic-vlms` repository, with support for training and evaluating
visually-conditioned language models; while you can use this repo to train VLMs AND VLAs, note that trying to generate
language (via `scripts/generate.py`) with existing OpenVLA models will not work (as we only train current OpenVLA models
to generate actions, and actions alone).

# 🔎 Evaluating with LIBERO Simulation Benchmark

In the [updated OpenVLA paper (v2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09246), we discuss fine-tuning OpenVLA
on a simulated benchmark, [LIBERO](https://libero-project.github.io/main.html), in Appendix E.
Please see the paper for details, such as how we modify the provided demonstration datasets to
improve the overall performance of all methods.

We copy the results to the section below and then discuss how to reproduce the results for OpenVLA.

## LIBERO Setup

Clone and install the [LIBERO repo](https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lifelong-Robot-Learning/LIBERO.git
cd LIBERO
pip install -e .
```

Additionally, install other required packages:
```bash
cd openvla
pip install -r experiments/robot/libero/libero_requirements.txt
# 再次确保torch和flash_attn的版本正确
pip install torch==2.8.0+cu128 torchvision==0.23.0+cu128 torchaudio==2.8.0+cu128 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
pip install "flash-attn==2.8.3" --no-build-isolation
```

(Optional) To download the modified versions of the LIBERO datasets that we used in our fine-tuning
experiments, run the command below. This will download the LIBERO-Spatial, LIBERO-Object, LIBERO-Goal,
and LIBERO-10 datasets in RLDS data format (~10 GB total). You can use these to fine-tune OpenVLA or
train other methods. This step is optional since we provide pretrained OpenVLA checkpoints below.
(Also, you can find the script we used to generate the modified datasets in raw HDF5 format
[here](experiments/robot/libero/regenerate_libero_dataset.py) and the code we used to convert these
datasets to the RLDS format [here](https://github.com/moojink/rlds_dataset_builder).)
```bash
git clone git@hf.co:datasets/openvla/modified_libero_rlds
```

## Launching LIBERO Evaluations

We fine-tuned OpenVLA via LoRA (r=32) on four LIBERO task suites independently: LIBERO-Spatial, LIBERO-Object, LIBERO-Goal, and LIBERO-10 (also called LIBERO-Long).
The four checkpoints are available on Hugging Face:
* [openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-spatial](https://huggingface.co/openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-spatial)
* [openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-object](https://huggingface.co/openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-object)
* [openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-goal](https://huggingface.co/openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-goal)
* [openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-10](https://huggingface.co/openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-10)

To start evaluation with one of these checkpoints, run one of the commands below. Each will automatically download the appropriate checkpoint listed above.

```bash
# Launch LIBERO-Spatial evals
python experiments/robot/libero/run_libero_eval.py \
  --model_family openvla \
  --pretrained_checkpoint openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-spatial \
  --task_suite_name libero_spatial \
  --center_crop True

# Launch LIBERO-Object evals
python experiments/robot/libero/run_libero_eval.py \
  --model_family openvla \
  --pretrained_checkpoint openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-object \
  --task_suite_name libero_object \
  --center_crop True

# Launch LIBERO-Goal evals
python experiments/robot/libero/run_libero_eval.py \
  --model_family openvla \
  --pretrained_checkpoint openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-goal \
  --task_suite_name libero_goal \
  --center_crop True

# Launch LIBERO-10 (LIBERO-Long) evals
python experiments/robot/libero/run_libero_eval.py \
  --model_family openvla \
  --pretrained_checkpoint openvla/openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-10 \
  --task_suite_name libero_10 \
  --center_crop True
```

* The evaluation script will run 500 trials by default (10 tasks x 50 episodes each). You can modify the number of
  trials per task by setting `--num_trials_per_task`. You can also change the random seed via `--seed`.
* **NOTE: Setting `--center_crop True` is important** because we fine-tuned OpenVLA with random crop augmentations
  (we took a random crop with 90% area in every training sample, so at test time we simply take the center 90% crop).
* The evaluation script logs results locally. You can also log results in Weights & Biases
  by setting `--use_wandb True` and specifying `--wandb_project <PROJECT>` and `--wandb_entity <ENTITY>`.
* The results reported in our paper were obtained using **Python 3.10.13, PyTorch 2.2.0, transformers 4.40.1, and
  flash-attn 2.5.5** on an **NVIDIA A100 GPU**, averaged over three random seeds. Please stick to these package versions.
  Note that results may vary slightly if you use a different GPU for evaluation due to GPU nondeterminism in large models
  (though we have tested that results were consistent across different machines with A100 GPUs).

## OpenVLA Fine-Tuning Results

| Method | LIBERO-Spatial | LIBERO-Object | LIBERO-Goal | LIBERO-Long | Average |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Diffusion Policy from scratch | 78.3 ± 1.1% | **92.5 ± 0.7%** | 68.3 ± 1.2% | 50.5 ± 1.3% | 72.4 ± 0.7% |
| Octo fine-tuned | 78.9 ± 1.0% | 85.7 ± 0.9% | **84.6 ± 0.9%** | 51.1 ± 1.3% | 75.1 ± 0.6% |
| OpenVLA fine-tuned (ours) | **84.7 ± 0.9%** | 88.4 ± 0.8% | 79.2 ± 1.0% | **53.7 ± 1.3%** | **76.5 ± 0.6%** |

Each success rate is the average over 3 random seeds x 500 rollouts each (10 tasks x 50 rollouts per task).
